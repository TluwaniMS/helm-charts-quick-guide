# What is Helm?

Helm stands as an open source package manager designed for Kubernetes, enabling the provisioning, sharing, and utilization of software developed for the Kubernetes environment.  What is a Chart?

A `Chart` stands as a Helm package encompassing all the essential resource explanations essential for executing an application, tool, or service within a Kubernetes cluster.

## How to create a Chart:

helm create <name_of_chart>

`Generates a directory for charts, accompanied by the standard files and folders utilized within a chart.`

## Chart directory guide.

* #### templates/ directory:

The `templates/` directory is for template files. 

* #### values.yaml file:
  
This file contains the default values for a chart.

* #### Chart.yaml file:
  
The `Chart.yaml` file contains a description of the chart.

## Chart.yaml file guide:

```

# Helm project practice commands

`NB!`

Please ensure that you have a running instance of minikube, before experimenting with the `helm commands`;
lastly make sure that you're in the projects root directory.🙂
* ### helm lint:
  
  Analyze a chart to identify potential issues.
  This instruction accepts a chart pathway and executes a sequence of tests to validate the proper structure of the chart.

  `helm lint PATH [flags]`

  rendering templates within the local context.

  `helm template [NAME] [CHART] [flags]`

  This instruction installs an archive of charts.

  `helm install [NAME] [CHART] [flags]`

* ### helm uninstall:

  uninstall a release
  This instruction requires a release name as input and proceeds to uninstall the mentioned release.
  It eliminates all the resources linked with the preceding chart release, along with its release history, making them available for future utilization.
